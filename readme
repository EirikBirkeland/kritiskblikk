In Norway, there is currently a single fact-checker (faktisk.no).

This extension will challenge the current fact-checking hegemony.
This tool will be available to any individual or group, regardless of their political POV.
The idea is to provide insightful commentary on popular current discourse.

Since the tool itself will merely be a framework, this is a non-partison tool.

The intent is to stimulate the ever-dying democracy
and to reduce the mind-numbing monotony of mainstream narratives
which are peddled in fanatical unison by the vast majority
of tax-subsidized media.
