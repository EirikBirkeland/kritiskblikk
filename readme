This extension will challenge the current fact-checking hegemony
prevalent in Western countries.

It will be available to any individual or group, regardless of their political POV.

The idea is for a variety of groups/individuals to provide high-quality curated commentary on popular current discourse.
Commentary will be easily available on various pages people visit in the form of pop-ups and similar.

Since the tool itself will merely be a framework, this is a non-partison tool.

The intent is to stimulate the ever-dying democracy
and to reduce the mind-numbing monotony of mainstream narratives
which are peddled in fanatical unison by the vast majority
of tax-subsidized media.

The target audience will be a normie who's somewhat open to having
their views challenged, all while browsing their favorite
mainmstream brainwashing.

Technically, there will be many ways of implementing this.

As a starting point, the extension will look at a lot like Dissenter.
If technically feasible, it will go beyond that and provide
in-line commentary, similarly to the review feature in
common word-processing software such as LibreOffice or OpenOffice.
